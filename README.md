| Component ID | Category     | Description                          |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1            | mask         | Masks and face coverings             |

| 11           | torso2       | Additional torso layers (coats, etc.)|

#### Example Usage:
```lua
-- For a mask
client = {
    category = 'mask',  -- Use the category name
    component = 1,      -- Use the component ID
    drawable = 0,
    texture = 0
}

-- For a jacket
client = {
    category = 'torso',  -- Use the category name
    component = 3,       -- Use the component ID
    drawable = 0,
    texture = 0
}
```

### Step 1: Prepare Your Clothing Items

#### For Default GTA Clothing
1. First, find the clothing item's drawable and texture IDs:
   - Use a tool like [GTA V Clothing ID Finder](https://gta5mod.net/gta-5-clothing-id-finder/)
   - Or use the in-game clothing store to find the IDs
   - Note down the component ID, drawable ID, and texture ID

2. Create the item in your QB-Core shared items:
```lua
['tshirt_white'] = {
    name = 'tshirt_white',
    label = 'White T-Shirt',
    weight = 200,
    type = 'item',
    image = 'tshirt_white.png',
    unique = true,
    useable = true,
    shouldClose = true,
    description = 'A simple white t-shirt',
    client = {
        category = 'torso',  -- The category it belongs to
        component = 11,      -- The component ID (11 for torso)
        drawable = 0,        -- The drawable ID
        texture = 0,         -- The texture ID
        rarity = 'common'    -- The rarity level
    }
}
```

#### For Addon Streamed Clothing
1. Install your addon clothing pack:
   - Place the .yft and .ytd files in your server's stream folder
   - Ensure the resource is properly configured in your server.cfg
   - Test that the models load correctly in-game

2. Create the item in your QB-Core shared items:
```lua
['addon_jacket_1'] = {
    name = 'addon_jacket_1',
    label = 'Addon Jacket 1',
    weight = 400,
    type = 'item',
    image = 'addon_jacket_1.png',
    unique = true,
    useable = true,
    shouldClose = true,
    description = 'A cool addon jacket',
    client = {
        category = 'torso',      -- The category it belongs to
        component = 11,          -- The component ID
        isAddon = true,          -- Mark as addon clothing
        model = 'addon_jacket_1', -- The model name from your addon pack
        drawable = 0,            -- The drawable ID
        texture = 0,             -- The texture ID
        rarity = 'rare'          -- The rarity level
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Add Items to Store Inventory

1. Open your `config.lua` file
2. Find the `Config.Stores` section
3. Add your items to the store's inventory:

```lua
Config.Stores = {
    ['suburban'] = {
        label = "Suburban",
        blip = {
            sprite = 73,
            color = 3,
            scale = 0.7,
            label = "Suburban"
        },
        clerk = {
            model = "s_m_m_gentransport",
            scenario = "WORLD_HUMAN_STAND_IMPATIENT"
        },
        priceMultiplier = 1.0,
        locations = {
            vector4(127.02, -223.69, 54.56, 68.0)
        },
        inventory = {
            -- Default GTA clothing
            ['tshirt_white'] = {
                price = 100,
                stock = 10,
                variations = {
                    {texture = 0, label = "White"},
                    {texture = 1, label = "Black"}
                }
            },
            -- Addon clothing
            ['addon_jacket_1'] = {
                price = 500,
                stock = 5,
                variations = {
                    {texture = 0, label = "Red"},
                    {texture = 1, label = "Blue"}
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Test Your Configuration

1. Restart your server
2. Visit the clothing store
3. Check that:
   - The items appear in the store inventory
   - The prices are correct
   - You can preview the items
   - You can purchase the items
   - The items appear correctly on your character

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Default GTA Clothing Issues
- **Clothing doesn't appear**: Double-check the component, drawable, and texture IDs
- **Wrong appearance**: Verify the category matches the component ID
- **Missing textures**: Ensure the texture ID exists for that drawable

#### Addon Clothing Issues
- **Model doesn't load**: 
  - Check the model name matches your addon pack
  - Verify the addon resource is started before vein-clothing
  - Ensure the .yft and .ytd files are in the correct location
- **Texture issues**:
  - Verify the texture IDs exist in your addon pack
  - Check that the texture files are properly named
- **Performance issues**:
  - Optimize your addon models
  - Use proper LODs
  - Consider streaming distance

### Best Practices

1. **Organization**:
   - Group similar items together in the config
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Document your item IDs and variations

2. **Performance**:
   - Limit the number of variations per item
   - Use appropriate rarity levels
   - Set reasonable stock limits

3. **User Experience**:
   - Provide clear item labels
   - Add helpful descriptions
   - Set appropriate prices based on rarity

4. **Maintenance**:
   - Keep a backup of your configuration
   - Document any custom changes
   - Test thoroughly after updates

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

            vector4(613.08, 2761.72, 42.09, 275.0)
        }
    }
}
```

### Prices and Rarity
```lua
Config.Rarity = {
    common = {
        maxStock = 15,
        priceMultiplier = 1.0
    },
    rare = {
        maxStock = 5,
        priceMultiplier = 2.5
    }
}
```

### Condition Settings
```lua
Config.Condition = {
    WornDegradationMin = 1,
    WornDegradationMax = 3,
    DirtyThreshold = 50,
